Javascript Challenges

Challenge 1

Make a terminal script that will create a journal with a short-term memory. Weird, I know.
Prompt a user for any content. What they did yesterday, what their favourite colour is, whatever. Store the user input in an array.
Print out all entries in the array.
Loop back and prompt the user for the next journal entry.
The journal can only contain a maximum of 5 entries, but can loop forever.


Challenge 2

Atomic Blonde Number:
a number is an atomic blonde number if the sum and product of its digits are equal.
For example, 123 is an atomic blonde number, as the sum of its digits (1+2+3) is 6, which is equal to the product of its digits (1*2*3).
Write a program to check if a number is an atomic blonde number or not. 


Challenge 3

Pick any four digit number and do the following:
Rearrange the string of digits to form the largest and smallest 4-digit numbers possible.
Take these two numbers and subtract the smaller number from the larger. 
Suppose we choose the number 8082.
8820−0288=8532
8532−2358=6174
7641−1467=6174 
It hits 6174 and then stops.
Count also how many iterations loops are required to get to this point.
Bonus points for recognising what 6174 is.
